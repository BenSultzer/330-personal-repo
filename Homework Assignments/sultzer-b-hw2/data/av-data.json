The 'Volume' slider adjusts volume and the 'Full Screen' button puts the app in full screen. Click anywhere on the canvas to exert a shockwave force according to where you clicked on all centrically emitted particles. Finally, the remaining controls are organized by their effect, and can be used to change various parts of the app, such as colors, particle properties, frequency versus waveform audio data, and more."

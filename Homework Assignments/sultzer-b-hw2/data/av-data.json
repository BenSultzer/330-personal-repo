    "appdescription": "This audio visualizer uses very simple custom particle systems that use a position and particle size driven by the analyzer node's frequency data. Higher frequencies are denoted by particle systems with smaller particles that appear higher on the screen. Lower frequencies are denoted by particle systems with larger particles that appear lower on the screen.<br><br>The 'Play' button is used to play and pause the current song, which can be changed using the 'Track' dropdown menu. The 'Volume' slider adjusts volume and the 'Full Screen' button puts the app in full screen. You can toggle various audio visualization options on and off using the checkboxes, such as boosting the treble (high) or bass (low) frequencies or showing/not showing the particles. Finally, the visualization data type can be changed between 'frequency' and 'waveform' using the 'Visualizaton Data Type' dropdown menu."
